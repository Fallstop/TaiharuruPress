Albert slips and screams into life in Middlesbrough, a small industrial town in England, in 1876. His
early poverty feeds a determination to grab a different, better life. At the age of seven he
immigrates to New Zealand with his family, full of dreams yet to be challenged by the reality of life in
the new country. As he grows into a man, Albert struggles to break free from familial ignorance so
he can gain wealth for himself and his family - but he finds himself seduced by the Boer War and
fighting for England. On his return to New Zealand a damaged Albert once again needs to invent his
future.
Albertâ€™s story follows a path of poverty, opportunity, loss, friendship and betrayal.

layers to come to a gripping conclusion.
